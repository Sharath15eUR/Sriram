### Q5) Difference between Bridge mode and Repeater mode 


| Feature               | Bridge Mode                                  | Repeater Mode                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Function**        | Connects two separate networks wirelessly or via Ethernet. | Extends the range of an existing wireless network. |
| **Working Principle** | Acts as a bridge between two different networks. | Receives Wi-Fi signals and rebroadcasts them. |
| **IP Network**      | Typically operates in a different subnet. | Uses the same IP subnet as the main network. |
| **Connectivity**    | Requires two or more routers or APs. | Works with a single main router/AP and a repeater. |
| **Data Handling**   | Forwards traffic between two networks without altering it. | Duplicates and amplifies the signal. |
| **Performance**    | Maintains network bandwidth and speed. | Reduces bandwidth due to signal retransmission. |
| **Latency**        | Low latency as it functions as a direct link. | Higher latency due to signal rebroadcasting. |
| **Signal Strength** | No signal amplification, only direct linking. | Boosts signal strength in weak coverage areas. |
| **Best Use Cases** | Connecting networks across buildings, wired-to-wireless integration. | Extending Wi-Fi coverage in large homes, offices. |
| **Interference**   | Minimal as data flows between two known points. | Higher interference due to retransmitted signals. 
| **Configuration Complexity** | More complex, requires proper network planning. | Easier to set up via router settings. |
