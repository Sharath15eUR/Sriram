### Q6. What are the differences between 802.11a and 802.11b? 
| Feature               | 802.11a                                     | 802.11b                                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Release Year**     | 1999                                     | 1999                                     |
| **Frequency Band**   | 5 GHz                                    | 2.4 GHz                                  |
| **Max Data Rate**    | Up to 54 Mbps                            | Up to 11 Mbps                            |
| **Channel Bandwidth**| 20 MHz                                   | 22 MHz                                   |
| **Modulation**       | OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) | DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) |
| **Range**           | Shorter due to high frequency            | Longer due to lower frequency           |
| **Interference**    | Less interference, as fewer devices use 5 GHz | More interference due to congestion in 2.4 GHz |
| **Wall Penetration** | Poorer (struggles with obstacles)       | Better (penetrates walls more effectively) |
| **Power Consumption**| Higher due to complex modulation        | Lower, making it more energy-efficient |
| **Network Type**     | Used mainly in enterprise and business environments | Used widely for residential and consumer devices |
| **Adoption**        | Less popular due to high cost and short range | Widely adopted for early Wi-Fi networks |
| **Compatibility**    | Not compatible with 802.11b/g           | Backward compatible with 802.11g |
| **Use Cases**       | Business, high-speed applications       | Home networks, IoT, and low-speed internet |
