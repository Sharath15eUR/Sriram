| Mode             | Structure                                                                 | Use Cases                                                                                  | Advantages                                              | Disadvantages                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure Mode** | Devices connect to a central Access Point (AP) or wireless router. | Used in homes, offices, and public Wi-Fi hotspots for centralized management.              | Centralized control, scalability, and wired network integration. | Network failure if the AP goes down.            |
| **Repeater Mode**       | A wireless device (repeater) receives signals and retransmits them. | Extends Wi-Fi coverage in large spaces or areas with weak signals.                        | Expands network without additional cabling.              | Can introduce latency and reduce network speed.  |
| **Bridge Mode**        | APs connect separate networks wirelessly, acting as a bridge.       | Connects two buildings' networks or integrates wired devices into a wireless network.     | Eliminates the need for physical cables between networks. | Requires compatible hardware for efficient setup. |
| **Ad Hoc Mode**        | Devices communicate directly without an AP (peer-to-peer network). | Used for temporary, small-scale networks (e.g., meetings, collaborative projects).       | No dependency on external infrastructure.               | Limited scalability and security concerns.       |
| **Mesh Mode**          | Multiple APs (nodes) dynamically connect, forming a self-healing network. | Provides large-scale Wi-Fi coverage (e.g., campuses, warehouses, outdoor areas). | Self-configuring, resilient, and eliminates dead zones. | Can be expensive and requires multiple APs.     |
