###  Q4) what are the basic functionalities of Wi-Fi Accesspoint 

```
A Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) is a networking device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi technology. Its primary functions include:

Wireless Connectivity:
---------------------

Provides a wireless network for devices like laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices to connect to a LAN (Local Area Network).

Bridging Wired and Wireless Networks:
------------------------------------

Acts as a bridge between Ethernet (wired) and Wi-Fi (wireless) networks, allowing seamless communication.

Signal Transmission and Reception:
---------------------------------

Uses radio waves to transmit and receive data packets between wireless devices and the main network.

Network Authentication and Security:
-----------------------------------

Implements security protocols such as WPA2, WPA3, and MAC address filtering to ensure only authorized users can connect.

Multi-Device Management:
------------------------

Supports multiple simultaneous connections by using techniques like MU-MIMO (Multi-User, Multiple Input, Multiple Output) and band steering.

Channel and Frequency Management:
---------------------------------

Operates on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz (or 6 GHz for Wi-Fi 6E) bands and automatically selects the least congested channel for optimal performance.

Roaming Support:
----------------

Enables seamless handoff between multiple APs in large networks (e.g., corporate offices, malls) to maintain uninterrupted connectivity.

Bandwidth Control and QoS:
-------------------------

Prioritizes critical applications like VoIP, video conferencing, and gaming using Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms.

DHCP Relay & IP Address Assignment:
-----------------------------------

Can act as a DHCP relay agent, forwarding IP address requests to a central DHCP server or assigning local IPs.

Traffic Monitoring & Logging:
-----------------------------

Logs network activity, traffic patterns, and connected clients, aiding in network management and security auditing.

Guest Network Creation:
----------------------

Allows the setup of a separate guest SSID, isolating guest users from the primary network for security.

Power Over Ethernet (PoE) Support (For enterprise APs):
-------------------------------------------------------

Enables APs to be powered via Ethernet cables, eliminating the need for separate power adapters.
