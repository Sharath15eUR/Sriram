### Q9. List down the type of Wi-Fi internet connectivity backhaul, share your home/college's wireless internet connectivity backhaul name and its properties 

```
Backhaul:
--------
A backhaul is the connection that bridges a local network (e.g., home or campus Wi-Fi) to the broader internet. 

The primary types include:
--------------------------

Fiber Optic Backhaul:
---------------------
Capable of delivering speeds ranging from 1 Gbps to over 10 Gbps, fiber offers minimal latency (typically 1–10 ms) and high reliability.
It is widely used in cities, large enterprises, and academic institutions, with technologies such as FTTH (Fiber to the Home).

DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) Backhaul:
---------------------------------------
This backhaul type operates over traditional copper telephone lines, offering speeds between 10 and 100 Mbps.
While it provides moderate reliability, its latency is higher (20–50 ms), making it common in residential areas.


Cable Broadband Backhaul:
----------------------------
Utilizing cable television infrastructure, this backhaul delivers speeds between 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps with moderate latency (10–50 ms).
It ensures high reliability but comes with shared bandwidth, affecting performance during peak usage.
The DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) standard is commonly used for this type.

4G LTE Backhaul:
-----------------
Used in mobile Wi-Fi hotspots, temporary setups, and rural broadband deployments, LTE backhaul supports speeds up to several
hundred Mbps with moderate latency depending on network conditions.

5G Backhaul:
-------------
Facilitates ultra-low latency applications, smart cities, and autonomous vehicle communication. 
Capable of speeds up to 10 Gbps, 5G backhaul is essential for high-bandwidth, real-time applications.

Ethernet Backhaul:
------------------
Preferred for enterprise Wi-Fi networks, office infrastructures, and campus access point connections. 
It provides high reliability and low latency with speeds often exceeding 1 Gbps.

Microwave Backhaul:
------------------
Supports internet connectivity in remote regions, as well as ISP backbone networks and cellular tower connections.
It can provide multi-Gbps speeds with latencies around 1–10 ms, making it a viable alternative to fiber in challenging deployment scenarios.

Satellite Backhaul:
--------------------
Often used in remote locations where terrestrial networks are unavailable, satellite-based backhaul can offer speeds up to 1 Gbps. 
However, it suffers from high latency due to the long-distance signal travel. Well-known providers include Starlink and HughesNet.
It is also utilized for maritime and aviation Wi-Fi services.

Mesh Wi-Fi Backhaul:
-----------------------
Best suited for large homes, offices, and campuses requiring seamless, wide-area Wi-Fi coverage. 
Mesh networks distribute backhaul traffic efficiently, reducing single-point failures.

Power Line Communication (PLC) Backhaul:
-----------------------------------------
Utilizes existing electrical wiring to transmit data, making it a cost-effective solution in certain deployments. 
It is often used in smart grid applications and home networking scenarios where traditional cabling is impractical.

College Wi-Fi Backhaul:
----------------------  

My college uses a wired backhaul for internet connectivity. This setup ensures a stable and high-speed connection, typically relying on fiber optic or Ethernet-based infrastructure. Wired backhaul provides low latency, high reliability, and consistent network performance, making it well-suited for academic environments where uninterrupted connectivity is crucial for research, online learning, and administrative operations.
