The ping Command :
------------------

Tests connectivity between your system and a target host (e.g., another computer or a server).
Sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request packets to the target and waits for echo replies.
Common Parameters and Options:

ping [destination]: Sends echo requests to the specified destination (domain name or IP address).
-c [count]: Specifies the number of ping packets to send before stopping (e.g., ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 sends 4 packets).
-i [interval]: Sets the interval (in seconds) between sending each packet.
-t [TTL]: Sets the Time To Live for packets, controlling how many hops they can take before being discarded.
-s [size]: Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent in each packet.

The arp Command:
--------------

Manages the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache, which maps IP addresses to physical (MAC) addresses on a local network.
Usage Examples:

arp -a: Displays all current ARP entries (i.e., the ARP table).
arp -d [hostname/IP]: Deletes an ARP entry for the specified host.
arp -s [hostname/IP] [MAC address]: Manually adds a static ARP entry.
Why It’s Useful:

Helps diagnose network issues by verifying that your system has correct mappings between IP addresses and MAC addresses.
Allows you to clear incorrect or stale ARP entries which might be causing connectivity issues.


The ifconfig Command :
---------------------

Used to configure and display network interface parameters.

Understanding Common Parameters from ifconfig Output:

Interface Name (e.g., eth0, wlan0):
-------------------------------------

The identifier for the network interface.

Flags:
-----
A set of status flags that indicate the interface’s state.
Example flags include:
UP: The interface is activated.
BROADCAST: Supports broadcasting.
RUNNING: Indicates that the interface is operational.
MULTICAST: Supports multicasting.

MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit):
---
The largest packet size (in bytes) that can be sent over the network interface.

inet (IPv4 Address):
--------------------

Displays the IPv4 address assigned to the interface.
netmask: Shows the subnet mask, which helps determine the network portion of the IP address.
broadcast: The broadcast address for the network, used to send messages to all devices on the subnet.


inet6 (IPv6 Address):
--------------------
Shows the IPv6 address assigned to the interface, along with the prefix length and scope.

ether (MAC Address):
---------------------
The hardware address unique to the network interface.

txqueuelen (Transmit Queue Length):
---------------------------------
The number of packets allowed in the queue for transmission. A longer queue can help if the interface experiences bursts of traffic.

RX/TX Packets and Bytes:
---------------------------
RX packets: Total number of packets received.
TX packets: Total number of packets transmitted.
RX bytes / TX bytes: Total data volume (in bytes) received and transmitted respectively.

Error Counters (for both RX and TX):
--------------------------------------
RX errors / TX errors: Counts of packets that encountered errors during reception or transmission.
dropped: Packets that were dropped.
overruns: Packets dropped because the device couldn’t handle the load quickly enough.
frame: Errors related to frame formats in the data.
carrier: Indicates issues with the network carrier signal.
collisions: Number of packet collisions detected on the network (more common in older or congested networks).
