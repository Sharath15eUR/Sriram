Question: explain how  a DHCP assigns IP addresses to the devices in its network 
--------
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automates the assignment of IP addresses 
and other network configuration details to devices on a network. 
This process is typically broken down into four main steps, commonly remembered by the acronym DORA.

DHCP Discover:
--------------

What Happens:
When a device (the client) connects to the network and needs an IP address, it broadcasts a DHCP Discover message. This message is sent to the network's broadcast address (e.g., 255.255.255.255) because the client does not yet have an IP address.

Purpose:
The Discover message helps the client locate any available DHCP servers on the network.


DHCP Offer:
-----------
What Happens:
Upon receiving the Discover message, one or more DHCP servers respond with a DHCP Offer message. This offer includes:

An available IP address.
The subnet mask.
The default gateway.
DNS server information.
The lease time (the duration for which the IP address is valid).
Purpose:
The Offer lets the client know what configuration details are available from that server.

DHCP Request:
--------------
What Happens:
The client reviews the offers it received (if there are multiple) and selects one. 
It then broadcasts a DHCP Request message, indicating which server's offer it is accepting.
 This message also serves as a notification to other DHCP servers that their offers were not chosen.

Purpose:
This step confirms the client's desire to use the offered IP address and other settings.

DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK):
----------------------------
What Happens:
The chosen DHCP server sends a DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK) message back to the client. This ACK message finalizes the lease agreement, 
confirming that the client now has the right to use the assigned IP address along with the provided configuration details.

Purpose:
The ACK solidifies the configuration, allowing the client to start using the network settings to communicate on the network and the internet.

Additional Points :
--------------------
Lease Renewal:
Before the lease time expires, the client will typically contact the DHCP server to renew its IP address lease. This ensures that the device maintains its configuration without interruption.

IP Address Reassignment:
If a client disconnects or shuts down, the DHCP server may reclaim the IP address after the lease expires, making it available for other devices.

Network Efficiency:
By automating IP address management, DHCP minimizes manual configuration errors and ensures that each device on the network receives a unique IP address.

DHCP Client Commands:
------------------

DHCP Client Commands and Usage

Linux (Using dhclient)
-----------------------

sudo dhclient -> Request an IP address from the DHCP server.

sudo dhclient -r -> Release the current DHCP lease.

sudo dhclient -v -> Run dhclient in verbose mode to see detailed output.

sudo dhclient -i <interface> -> Request an IP address for a specific network interface (e.g., eth0).

sudo dhclient -x -> Stop the running DHCP client.

Windows (Using ipconfig and netsh)
-------------------------------------

ipconfig /release -> Release the current DHCP lease.

ipconfig /renew -> Request a new IP address from the DHCP server.

ipconfig /all -> Display all current IP configuration details.

netsh interface ip set address "Ethernet" dhcp -> Set a network interface (e.g., Ethernet) to obtain an IP via DHCP.

netsh interface ip set dns "Ethernet" dhcp -> Set DNS configuration to be obtained via DHCP.

netsh int ip reset -> Reset the TCP/IP stack, useful for troubleshooting.
